<h1>Barbarian Village Fisher - Personal Project</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
This is a game automation program used to automate fishing in the game Old School Runescape.
<br><br>
In Runescape, players can use fish to heal missing their missing health during crucial fights, often in hopes of gaining valuable loot. Fish itself can be a lucractive trade due to its high demand. The advantage of using this application removes the tediousness of manually collecting the fish and automates the entire process.

With multiple bots setup, large amounts of cryptocurrency can be obtained and exchanged for significant real world currency.
